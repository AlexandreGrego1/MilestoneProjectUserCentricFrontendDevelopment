- Hamburger and nav button with transform translatex (0) applied bringing an animation to hide the navigation buttons from main menu on the home page;
#####RESUME

For personal details, the screen is developed to take 1/3 of the screen, and the About Me is developed to take 2/3 of the screen when it is displayed on desktop view. Both screen is developed to open on responsive view floating to left and aligning to the center page displaying the context underneath to the subsequence context;
