## MOBILE WIREFRAMES

The layout placement and how they interact with one another goes through many stages, from conception to mockups to finalized UI is based on responsive view.

## BARRIES TO TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT

As my limited knowledge of development tools, I have developed my portfolio in the same stands as my resume project lecture. Althought my limited knologment, I have applyied my own caracteristics to my project trying to give my particular caracteristics to this portfolio. 

After developed my first project, I have noticed that I should not hurry up trying to finish the module as quick as possible. In my opinion after this project, I would save much more time with I had spent more time trying to understand some concepts before going to the next module.
