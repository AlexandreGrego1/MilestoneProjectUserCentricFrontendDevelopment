# Personal Portfolio Alexandre Gregoio,

Welcome recruiters,

I am a flexible professional, who enjoys learning new skills quickly adapts to new tasks and is able to build positive relationships with clients and colleagues at all organizational levels. Working in a busy administrative environment in Swords, Co. Dublin since May/2017 completing Customs Clearances. 

Ability to work under pressure, to prioritize tasks and work on my own initiative with an excellent PC literacy/keyboard and attention to detail.



## OVERVIEW

I currently work for a Logistics company but the last December I was told by management that staff in our section will be made redundant, as our client was taking their
logistics functions back in-house. However, I will be laid off soon, so I believe this is an opportunity for a career change, retraining as a Code Programmer, an area that first interested me when I was studying for my degree. 

Since September/2020, I have been attending in a Fullstack Web Developer course at Code Instutite Dublin. I have been coding as frontend and backend developer with HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Python/Django. 

Although I am thirty-six years old, I have worked for more than twenty years of my life accumulating a variety of experience in different sorts of jobs. I am a self-starter and highly motivated, put myself through university as a mature student, and will apply myself with the same dedication and hard work to completing the course of Diploma in Full Stack Software Development.

I believe that I would be a worthy candidate for your company. My career and educational achievements to date show my willingness to work hard in order to achieve my goals. I believe that I have the relevant background and mental discipline to successfully work for this reputable company.
